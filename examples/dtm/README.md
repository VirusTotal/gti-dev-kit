# **Google Threat Intelligence (GTI) Digital Threat Monitoring (DTM) Scripts**

This repository contains Python scripts to work with the Digital Threat Monitoring (DTM) part of the Google Threat Intelligence (GTI) API. DTM continuously monitors the deep and dark web for mentions of specific topics or entities (e.g., brand names, credentials) defined in organizational Monitors, generating alerts for potential threats like phishing campaigns, brand impersonation, or data leaks.These scripts provide example GTI DTM integrations to enable security teams to proactively identify and mitigate external threats by retrieving and processing DTM alerts efficiently.

## **Overview**

The `ingest_dtm_alerts.py` and `ingest_dtm_alerts_with_polling.py` scripts streamline the retrieval of DTM alerts from the GTI API, providing structured JSON output for easy analysis. They support configurable query parameters (e.g., time range, severity, alert type) and robust error handling for reliable operation. The `ingest_dtm_alerts_with_polling.py` script adds pagination and periodic querying to keep alert data current, making it ideal for continuous monitoring. These scripts facilitate integration with security platforms to create incidents, track alert status, and synchronize updates with the GTI platform.

## **DTM Scripts**

- **Objective**: Integrate DTM alerts from GTI to proactively identify and mitigate external threats like phishing campaigns, brand impersonation, and data leaks.  
    
- **Key Implementation Points**:  
    
  - Automatically create corresponding incidents, cases, or alerts in the host platform based on ingested DTM data.  
  - Provide mechanisms to track the status of a DTM alert, from discovery to takedown.  
  - Ensure the integration can handle large volumes of DTM data efficiently without causing performance issues or blocking the application/platform instance.  
  - Send DTM alert updates, such as status changes, back to the GTI platform to keep data in sync.


- **Relevant API Calls**:  
    
  - `/dtm/alerts`: Fetches DTM alerts based on query parameters like time range, severity, and alert type.


- **User Experience (UX) Best Practice**:  
    
  - Automatically prioritize DTM alerts based on severity to streamline analyst workflows and focus on high-risk threats.


- **Configuration Tip**:  
    
  - Allow users to create filtering rules to specify which types of DTM alerts (e.g., phishing, malware, brand abuse) should be automatically ingested and escalated. Configure polling intervals and alert limits to balance API quota and data freshness.

## **Scripts Overview**

The repository includes the following scripts, tailored to fetch and process DTM alerts from the GTI API for threat monitoring and analysis.

#### **`ingest_dtm_alerts.py`**

- **Purpose**: Fetches DTM alerts from the GTI API with configurable parameters, displaying up to three alerts in a formatted JSON output.  
    
- **Key Features**:  
    
  - **DTM Alert Retrieval**: Queries the `/dtm/alerts` endpoint with filters like date, score, severity, and alert type.  
  - **Threat Detection**: Identifies mentions of monitored entities (e.g., brand names, credentials) on the deep and dark web.  
  - **Structured Output**: Presents alert data in a clear, formatted JSON structure.  
  - **Error Handling**: Manages API request failures (e.g., network issues, HTTP errors) with retry suggestions.


- **API Endpoints Used**:  
    
  - `/dtm/alerts`: Fetches DTM alerts based on query parameters.


- **Use Case**: One-time retrieval of DTM alerts for initial threat analysis or manual review.

#### **`ingest_dtm_alerts_with_polling.py`**

- **Purpose**: Fetches DTM alerts with pagination and periodic polling, displaying up to three alerts per poll in a formatted JSON output.  
    
- **Key Features**:  
    
  - **DTM Alert Retrieval**: Queries the `/dtm/alerts` endpoint with configurable parameters.  
  - **Pagination Handling**: Parses pagination tokens from response headers to handle large datasets.  
  - **Error Handling**: Manages HTTP errors, rate limits, and network issues with retry logic.  
  - **Polling Mechanism**: Polls the API at configurable intervals for continuous monitoring.  
  - **Structured Output**: Presents alert data in formatted JSON for quick analysis.


- **API Endpoints Used**:  
    
  - `/dtm/alerts`: Fetches DTM alerts with pagination support.


- **Use Case**: Continuous monitoring of DTM alerts for real-time threat detection and integration with security platforms.

## **Input Parameters**

- **monitor\_id**  
    
  - **Description**: Only return alerts for the given monitor IDs  
  - **Example**: \["amazon123dft", "sfdsfds123"\]


- **since**  
    
  - **Description**: Time from when alerts should be retrieved (must be within the last 5 days)  
  - **Example**: "2025-05-10T00:00:00+00:00"


- **status**  
    
  - **Description**: Filter alerts by their status. This parameter can be specified multiple times. Possible values are new, read, escalated, in\_progress, closed, no\_action\_required, duplicate, not\_relevant, and tracked\_external  
  - **Example**: \["new", "read"\]


- **alert\_type**  
    
  - **Description**: Filter alerts by alert type. This parameter can be specified multiple times. Possible values are Compromised Credentials, Domain Discovery, Forum Post, Message, Paste, Shop Listing, Tweet, and Web Content  
  - **Example**: \["Paste", "Message"\]


- **tags**  
    
  - **Description**: Filter alerts by tag(s). This parameter can be used more than once to filter on multiple tags  
  - **Example**: \["amazon"\]


- **match\_value**  
    
  - **Description**: If specified, then only alerts that have the given match value are returned. This parameter can be repeated multiple times  
  - **Example**: \["amazon"\]


- **severity**  
    
  - **Description**: Return alerts that have the given severity. This parameter can be repeated multiple times. Possible values are high, medium and low  
  - **Example**: \["low", "medium"\]


- **mscore\_gte**  
    
  - **Description**: Filter alerts with mscores greater than or equal to the given value

- **search**  
    
  - **Description**: Search alert and triggering doc contents based on a simple Lucene query string including 1 or more text values separated by AND or OR  
  - **Example**: "severity:50"

## **Additional Notes**

- **Query Customization**: Adjust the `params` dictionary in either script to filter alerts by criteria like `severity`, `alert_type`, or `monitor_id`. Refer to the GTI API documentation for valid filter values.  
    
- **API Quota Management**: Both scripts include retry logic for HTTP 429 (rate limit) and 5xx errors. Monitor API usage to stay within your quota, especially during frequent polling.  
    
- **Error Handling**: The scripts handle network failures, invalid responses, and parsing errors, providing clear feedback and retry suggestions. Check console output for error details.  
    
- **Script Documentation**: Both scripts contain detailed comments explaining their functionality, parameters, and error handling.  
    
- **Output Storage**: By default, outputs are printed to the console. Modify the scripts to save alert data to a file (e.g., JSON or CSV) for integration with SIEM or incident management systems.  
    
- **GTI API Documentation**: For endpoint details and query syntax, refer to the official [GTI Documentation](https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/reference/get-alerts).  
    
- **Troubleshooting**: Create a `docs/troubleshooting.md` file for common issues like API errors, rate limits, or invalid filters, or refer to console output for error details.  
    
- **Integration Tips**: Use the scriptsâ€™ output to create incidents in your platform, track alert status (e.g., new, resolved), and send status updates back to the GTI API using appropriate endpoints (e.g., `/dtm/alerts/{id}`).
